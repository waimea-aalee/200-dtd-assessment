# Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Supply List**

Project Author: **Azaria Lee**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

My project will be a list formed in a mobile app for easy accessibility for the end users so, the list can be easily modified, as for end users may vary in levels of IT skill. Requirements may need some easy to read, bold and big font. The list should include where last left so remembering where everything is is easier. The buttons should all be easy to tell what they are for; e.g. home icon to go back to the home page.

### Identified Need or Problem

I noticed a problem with some people is keeping track of supplies, like if you are a builder and there are lots of things you contantly lose or forget where they are.

### End-User Requirements

The typical end users will have a job that involves having a lot of stock that makes it hard to keep track of. Their levels of skill with IT may vary, as well as age so it should be simplistic and easy to understand what is going on. More requirements may be text font, size and colours.

### Proposed Solution

A website or app that will be easy to keep track of any supplies.

The end user should be able to:
- See a list of what they have
- Easily modify info on stock
- Add new stock

And the system should be

- Easy to use and understand for all IT skills
- Accessible to all

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

Usability means how easy the project is to use for the end user.

The usability in this project is important so that the end user is able to use the site correctly and with ease.

To achieve this I will refer to Nielsen's usability heuristics by making sure the menu is easy to see and always available to get to, the design should have familiar icons like an x icon for delete. It needs to have obvious buttons, so if the end user accidentally clicks something there is a back button to back out. It needs to be obvious to understand what is going on on every page with easy to understand words. All this will make it easier for the end user especially if they are not very skilled with IT.

### Functionality

Functionality means how well the site works for the end user and is doing what it intends.

The functionality is important because if the project does not work how intended it would be frustrating for the end user.

When making my site I will need to consider that it meets the needs of the end users requirements/needs. It also needs to do and cope with all actions e.g. if invalid action done, an end user friendly error message will come up instead of the whole page coming up with a bunch of error code, and all commands and buttons are working correctly

Fully satisfy the original need / purpose

### End User

End user means that the site or app is working how a specific end user may need

This implication is important because if it was not adjusted to the end users needs it will make it difficult to use your site and they will most likely just use another that meets their needs better.

When making my site I will need to consider things about the end user such as, age and interests, if it appeals to the correct audience and what device they are most likely going to use. I will try to know as much as I can about the end user for things such as age, gender, interests and correct language. I should make sure the end user can input feedback to the site so they can help with design and make it a better experience for them and everyone.

### Aesthetics

Aesthetics relates to how the design looks

This is important because certain designs will appeal to certain or different audiences and the font style is nice for the end user ie they can read the font

When making my site I will need to consider how it appeals to the correct audience, create a design that is suitable for the purpose, use colours that work well together and are pleasing, use fonts to have an appropriate 'feel', group/seperate elements to focus attention on linked related items.

## Final System Design

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *final design* of your database: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place images here that show your *final design* of your UI: layout, colours, etc.


-------------------------------------------------

## Completed System

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *actual database structure* that you implemented: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place screenshots and notes here that show your *actual system UI* in action.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.

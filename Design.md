## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Replace this text with a clearly stated problem or need that exists that your project will attempt to solve / fulfil.

### End-User Requirements

Replace this text with a description of your typical end-users and their specific needs / expectations / requirements.

### Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.


-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

Usability means how easy the project is to use for the end user.

The usability in this project is important so that the end user is able to use the site correctly and with ease.

To achieve this I will make sure the menu is easy to see and always available to get to, the design should have familiar icons like an x icon for delete. It needs to have obvious buttons, so if the end user accidentally clicks something there is a back button to back out. It needs to be obvious to understand what is going on on every page with easy to understand words. All this will make it easier for the end user especially if they are not very skilled with IT.

### Functionality

Functionality means how well the site works for the end user and is doing what it intends.

The functionality is important because if the project does not work how intended it would be frustrating for the end user.

When making my site I will need to consider that it meets the needs of the end users requirements/needs. It also needs to do and cope with all actions e.g. if invalid action done, an end user friendly error message will come up instead of the whole page coming up with a bunch of error code, and all commands and buttons are working correc;y

Fully satisfy the original need / purpose
